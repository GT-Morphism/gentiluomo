description: Maybe there's a happy little tree... he lives right there.
tldr:
  A very quiet little sky. Every highlight needs its own private shadow. Just go around and try them
  all. Don't want to destroy, just diffuse. That's the most fun of all. We never duplicate anything
  exactly. Maybe there's a happy little tree... he lives right there. Think like a cloud. How
  beautifully it works! Today, I want softness in our world... tranquility, quiet, peaceful.

## Coole Sache

A very quiet little sky. Every highlight needs its own private shadow. Just go around and try them
all. Don't want to destroy, just diffuse. That's the most fun of all. We never duplicate anything
exactly. Maybe there's a happy little tree... he lives right there. Think like a cloud. How
beautifully it works! Today, I want softness in our world... tranquility, quiet, peaceful.
